- When you select a line with the select tool, the shape fill colorpicker is disabled, since line does not contain a shapefill(it contains a line color).

- If a shape with no border is selected with the select tool, then the line color color picker will have null value. The line thickness property and the line style property will be disabled, since the shape has no border.
